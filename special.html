<h2><a name="writable"></a> disabling pushes to take backups</h2>

<p>The <code>writable</code> command allows you to disable pushes to all repos or just the
named repo, in order to do file-system level things to the repo directory that
require it not to change, like using normal backup software.</p>

<p>Run <code>gitolite writable -h</code> for more info.</p>

<h2><a name="pers"></a> "personal" branches</h2>

<p>"personal" branches are great for environments where developers need to share
work but can't directly pull from each other (usually due to either a
networking or authentication related reason, both common in corporate setups).</p>

<p>Personal branches exist <strong>in a namespace</strong> of their own.  The syntax is</p>

<pre><code>    RW+ personal/USER/  =   @userlist
</code></pre>

<p>where the "personal" can be anything you like (but cannot be empty), and the
"/USER/" part is <strong>necessary (including both slashes)</strong>.</p>

<p>A user "alice" (if she's in the userlist) can then push any branches inside
<code>personal/alice/</code>.  Which means she can push <code>personal/alice/foo</code> and
<code>personal/alice/bar</code>, but NOT <code>personal/alice</code>.</p>

<p>(Background: at runtime the "USER" component will be replaced by the name of
the invoking user.  Access is determined by the right hand side, as usual).</p>

<p>Compared to using arbitrary branch names on the same server, this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces namespace pollution by corralling all these ad hoc branches into
the "personal/" namespace.</li>
<li>Reduces branch name collision by giving each developer her own
sub-hierarchy within that.</li>
<li>Removes the need to think about access control, because a user can push
only to his own sub-hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>delegating access control responsibilities</h2>

<p>See <a href="deleg.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="keysonly"></a> using pubkeys obtained from elsewhere</h2>

<p>If you're not managing keys via the gitolite-admin repo, but getting them from
somewhere else, you'll want to periodically "update" the keys.</p>

<p>To do that, first edit your rc file and add something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SSH_AUTHKEYS                =&gt;
    [
        'post-compile/ssh-authkeys',
    ],
</code></pre>

<p>Then write a script that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>gets all the keys and dumps them into <code>$HOME/.gitolite/keydir</code> (or into a
subdirectory of it).</p></li>
<li><p>runs <code>gitolite trigger SSH_AUTHKEYS</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Run this from cron or however you want.</p>

<h2><a name="pushhook"></a> updating hooks via the admin repo</h2>

<p>Gitolite by default maintains the distinction between someone who can push to
the admin repo and someone who has shell access to the server.  As a result,
you cannot change any hooks merely by pushing the admin repo.</p>

<p>But some people don't care about this and want to do it anyway.  Besides,
there <em>is</em> one advantage: your hooks can also be versioned now.</p>

<p>So here's how to add/change hooks when you push the gitolite-admin repo:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put all common hooks in a new directory called 'common-hooks'.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a trigger program called 'propagate-hooks' in 'src/triggers' that
contains this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

cd $GL_ADMIN_BASE
cp -a common-hooks/* hooks/common

gitolite setup --hooks-only
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add this to the <code>POST_COMPILE</code> trigger list in the rc file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that should be it, pretty much.</p>

<p>If you have lots of repos this is inefficient -- because the hook fixup will
run on <em>any</em> change to the admin repo, even if the change has nothing to do
with hooks.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about this, put the script in 'src/commands' instead of
'src/triggers'.  (You might want to add some access control; see other
commands for inspiration, but it's not really needed in this case).</p>

<p>Then, whenever any hooks have changed, the admin can run</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@host propagate-hooks
</code></pre>
